## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am smm9509@rit.edu . That's the username I get with my university, RIT.

I'm taking a FOSS development course that expects me to have a Github profile.

My major is in the College of Engineering Technology, so several courses I'm taking have subject codes ending in ET like CPET.

My favorite repository on Github is Qalculate by Hanna Knutson. I use the program for solving engineering problems with math.

Pronouns: she/her

Fun Fact: I do believe these profiles are indexed by search engines so I intentionally do not reveal much personally identifiable information.
